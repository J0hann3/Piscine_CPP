 A string variable initialized to "HI THIS IS BRAIN".
• stringPTR: A pointer to the string.
• stringREF: A reference to the string.
Your program has to print:
• The memory address of the string variable.
• The memory address held by stringPTR.
• The memory address held by stringREF.
And then:
• The value of the string variable.
• The value pointed to by stringPTR.
• The value pointed to by stringREF
